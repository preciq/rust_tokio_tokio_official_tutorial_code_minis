A stream is the asynchronous version of an iterator

It can be evaluated asynchronously, and the individual elements within streams themselves may be futures
I.e. we could store a number of API responses (which are still evaluating, ergo Futures) into a stream and process them one at a time
    We can also add additional stuff to the stream, to be evaluated later

A lot of the functions we could apply to iterators also apply to streams as well.

To be able to work with streams, import the tokio-stream crate

tokio-stream = "0.1.14"

Note that this crate is separate because the "Stream" trait is still not fully added to vanilla rust (as of 01/31/2023)
    This will be merged with the main tokio crate once it is
