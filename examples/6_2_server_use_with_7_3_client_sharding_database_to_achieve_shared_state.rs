Another possible strategy that can be used to share the state of a database is "Sharding"
This involves breaking the database up into Shards, or individual pieces, and using hashing to determine which shard should contain which key
Explained below

/*
Here, we create the type of the Sharded database
The Arc is so this database may be owned by multiple threads/tasks
The outer Vec holds all of the individual shards that comprise the database
Each individual shard is held in a Mutex, so that it may be modified from multiple threads
    This is of course unlikely since there are so many shards and few connections, but for scaling, as connections increase, we can increase the number of shards
    The Mutex is there to handle this situation
The HashMap IS the individual shard, within which keys are of type "String" and values are of type Bytes
    Bytes work similarly to Vec<u8> but they can be passed around easily between threads (and owned by multiple threads)
    Bytes type is roughly an Arc<Vec<u8>> but with some added capabilities

                Explanation of a hasher
                The reason for a hasher is to turn the key into a u64 (We take the key that is received from the connection, hasher takes this key (key.hash and then hasher.finish) and turns it into a unique u64 value
                We then divide this value by the length of db and take the remainder (modulus)
                    Recall that this is the number of created shards
                The result is a value between 0 and the number of shards (1000 in this case, so 0 - 999)
                This value is used to assign which shard this key will be assigned to
                This saves time/computational power because every key will always give the same u64 when hashed
                This value can then be used to find out EXACTLY which shard this key is being stored in
